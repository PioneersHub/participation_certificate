Dear {attendee.first_name},

We are thrilled to enclose your Certificate of Attendance for the recent conference. It’s our pleasure to provide this complimentary certificate to all attendees as a token of our appreciation for your participation.

To ensure the authenticity of your certificate, we’ve included a link within the PDF that allows for easy verification through our website.

Please keep in mind that the certificates are issued based on the information provided during registration, and we are unable to make any changes to the details.

2024 Certificates will be available for downloaded until 31.12.2024. Please ensure that you download it by then:
{conf.certificates_url}{attendee.uuid}.pdf

Thank you for being a part of our event. We hope to see you again at future conferences!

All the best,
{conf.event_full_name} Team"""
